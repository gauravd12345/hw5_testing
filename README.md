**Used when:** Checking individual pieces of code during development.

### Integration test

Tests how different parts of the program work together.
**Used when:** Making sure combined modules or systems interact correctly.

## Question 2

### Pytest discovery

Pytest finds tests in files named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`, and runs functions that start with `test_`.

### Fixture

A fixture is a setup helper that provides data or resources a test needs.
It’s made with `@pytest.fixture` and passed into test functions.
